[li]Extensible architecture ( device dashboard & panel can be extended by a custom JS module ). developpers are welcomed to contact me on how to do this.  There is a UPNP action called [u]registerPlugin()[/u] for plugins to dynamically register with ALTUI, @reneboer used it and explained here: http://forum.micasaverde.com/index.php/topic,30310.msg242498.html#msg242498[/li]
[li]Selectable home page by a url parameter ( home= )[/li]

[li]Themes & Styling[/li]
[list]
[li]you can take a bootstrap CSS from any bootstrap 3 CSS web sites out there providing template, or you can start from the default[/li]
[li]you then create your own CSS file which is incremental to that initial base[/li]
[li]you put that CSS file somewhere ( I put mines on my google drive ) , you can put it on your vera under /www and point to it if you are concerned about working without internet dependency.[/li]
[li]if your css file points to a bitmap, you will also need to put these bitmap file somewhere, note the url and make your CSS point to it. your CSS typically include things like : 
background-image: url(http://ssssssss/mycss.css);[/li]
[li]you declare the path of that CSS into the variable [b]ThemeCSS[/b] of your ALTUI device[/li]
[li]you reload ALTUI/refresh browser[/li]
[li][u][b]Example [/b][/u]: I provided the working example of fixed wood texture background with transparency in the "Styling" folder in the code.mios.com repository that you can access: http://code.mios.com/trac/mios_alternate_ui/browser [/li]
[li]More info on theming: [url=http://forum.micasaverde.com/index.php/topic,30310.msg243792.html#msg243792]http://forum.micasaverde.com/index.php/topic,30310.msg243792.html#msg243792[/url][/li]
[/list]
[/list]

Although the prefered way to customize the display of a device in ALTUI is to write a small javascript plugin, 
ALTUI provides a fast and easy customization of display of a device by the mean of 2 reserved service/variables 
that can be added manually by the user to any device. ID = 'urn:upnp-org:serviceId:altui1' , Variable = 'DisplayLine1' and 'DisplayLine2'
[list type=decimal]
[li]you add the variables to the device.[/li]
[li]if no drawing plugin is specified , then altui will look for these variables, if found, it will display one ( or both ) 
per line. each variable text content is included in a <div> which has a CSS class called altui-DisplayLine1 or 
altui-DisplayLine2 for possible theming if needed. Variable content will be HTML encoded so that HTML injection is not possible[/li]
[li]if no drawing plugin is specified and if ALTUI does not find these one of these 2 variables, it will display the default 
ellipsis glyph , signifying "default drawing"[/li]
[/list]


[b]Prerequisite requirements[/b]
[list]
[li]Just a classical plugin , no extra HW or servers[/li]
[/list]

[b]ALTUI Device VARIABLES[/b]
[list]
[li][b]PluginConfig [/b]: JSON structure to configure ALTUI optional modules. a UPNP action registerPlugin() can be used to programmatically add a ALTUI-plugin for custom device drawing[/li]
[li][b]RemoteAccess [/b]: remote access url for MMS login[/li]
[li][b]ThemeCSS [/b]: a full url to download a CSS skin for ALTUI[/li]
[li][b]UI7Check [/b]: true if running on UI7[/li]
[li][b]Version [/b]: the Lua plugin version[/li]
[li][b]LocalCDN [/b]: a full path name from VERA root '/' where the necessary files for ALTUI are stored. can be left empty and ALTUI will get files from the internet but this option enables an internet free operation of ALTUI[/li]
[li][b]ExtraController [/b]: a optional , comma seperated list of additional VERA controllers to use. the main controller must not be listed and this variable can be left emtpy if you use only one VERA with ALTUI[/li]
[li][b]Debug [/b]: 1 for extra debugging logs[/li]
[li][b]Data_xx_xx[/b] variables : internal storage for ALTUI user pages definitions[/li]
[li][b]Data_CustomPages_0[/b] : JSON array of user custom page names[/li]
[li][b]VariablesToWatch[/b]: semi column ';' seperated list of watch variable instructions. Each watch is instructions is in this format : "service#variable#deviceid#sceneid#lua_expr#blockly xml".
sceneid is the scene to run if the lua expression is true. lua expressions uses old and new as variables for the watched variable where old = previous value and new = new value. example:
urn:micasaverde-com:serviceId:SceneController1#LastSceneID#208#71#(old==2)and(new==1) (the xml is optional and only there if the expression was edited with the [u][b]Blockly[/b][/u] editor). 
ALTUI scene editor will take care of editing this [b]VariablesToWatch[/b] variable.
[/li]
[/list]

[b]LocalCDN[/b]
LocalCDN is for advanced user only. it enables internet less working mode for ALTUI but warning some features are not supported in that mode:
- weather widget
- google gauge

Another warning : not properly following the version updates of the css or js files of the various libraries ( when ALTUI updates its versions levels ) will likely result in malfunctions very difficult to find. 

You will find here below a working example of a localCDN setup:
1- on vera, create a /www/localcdn folder
2- copy and mirror http://code.mios.com/svn/mios_alternate_ui/localcdn/ folders and file found here.  that means you should have on your VERA a /www/localcdn/root with css and js files inside and a /www/localcdn/fonts folder with some font files inside
3- set your ALTUI device variable "LocalCDN" to be "/localcdn/root"

you should now be all set, do not forget to refresh your browser cache
