Z-Wave node of other types can be added to the system and will also act as repeaters if they support this function of repeating the signal received to other modules in the system.<\/p> <p>As part of a Z-Wave network, the TZ35S will also act as a wireless repeater to insure the commands intended for another device in the network are received.<\/p> <h1>Basic Operation<\/h1> <h2>(Local control)<\/h2> <p>The switch on the TZ35S allows the user to:<\/p> <ul><li>Turn ON\/OFF or Dimming the attached load<\/li> <li>Include or exclude the module from the Z-Wave system<\/li> <li>Control other Z-Wave enabled devices<\/li> <\/ul><p>Also, when a controller prompts you to \"Send Node ID\" or to \"Press Button on Unit\", quickly tap the switch ON or OFF once to satisfy those instructions.<\/p> <ul><li>Tapping top of the switch turns the load attached ON<\/li> <li>Tapping bottom of switch turns the load attached OFF<\/li> <li>Pressing and holding the switch will allow dimming and brightening of the attached load or the other Z-Wave dimmers if associated.<\/li> <\/ul><p><strong>Caution<\/strong>: When dimmed to the lowest setting, even though the load looks like its off it still has power.
