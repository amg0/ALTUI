    "overview": "<p>Thanks for choosing the Vision\u2019s wireless siren &amp; strobe alarm of the home security device. This sensor is a Z-Wave\u2122 enabled device (interoperable, two-way RF mesh networking technology) and is fully compatible with any Z-Wave\u2122 enabled network and it\u2019s security framework. Every mains powered Z-Wave\u2122 enabled device acts as a signal repeater and multiple devices result in more possible transmission routes which helps eliminate \u201cRF dead-sports\u201d.<\/p> <p>Z-Wave\u2122 enabled devices displaying the Z-Wave\u2122 logo can also be used with it regardless of the manufacturer, and ours can also be used in other manufacturer\u2019s Z-Wave\u2122 enabled networks. This product will sound a loud siren and flash a strobe light when an alarm message or alert is received on any Z-Wave\u2122 enabled network. When the ZM 1602 main power has dropped out, the backup batteries will automatically install. When the device is secure included into Z-Wave network, above communication will be encrypted<\/p>",
    "inclusion": "<p>For \u201cInclusion\u201d in (adding to) a network: Put the Z-Wave\u2122 Interface Controller into \u201cinclusion\u201d mode, and following its instruction to add the ZM 1602 to your controller. To get in the \u201cinclusion\u201d mode, the distance between siren and controller is suggested to be in one meter. Open the bracket and press the program switch of ZM 1602 for 1 second at least &amp; release to be included. After setting, the LED Setting Lighting should go off, if not, please try again. (After sending one time\u2019s Z-Wave NIF and not be included then it will send 4 times NWI in every 4 ~ 6 seconds for auto inclusion. The LED Setting Light will flash again if the siren has not\u00a0been included or the LED Setting Light will go off after inclusion.)<\/p>",
    "exclusion": "<p>For \u201cExclusion\u201d from (removing from) a network: Set up the Z-Wave\u2122 Interface Controller into \u201cexclusion\u201d mode, and following its instruction to delete the ZM 1602 from your controller. Press the Tamper Switch of ZM 1602 for 1 second at least &amp; release to be excluded. 9. Note: a. LED setting light will flash continuously in Exclusion condition. b. All user and network settings will be cleared and the device reset to factory defaults when the device is excluded. c. ZM 1602 can only connect to DC 12~39V, AC 9~28V Power adaptor d. ZM 1602 is extremely LOUD, please don\u2019t near your ear when you test!<\/p>",
